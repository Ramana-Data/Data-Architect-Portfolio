# DataWarehouseDemo

## Overview

This project demonstrates the setup and design of a simple data warehouse architecture for analytics.  
It covers data modeling, ETL pipeline development, and loading data to a cloud data warehouse (e.g., AWS Redshift, Snowflake, or BigQuery).

## Technologies

- Python
- SQL
- Cloud Data Warehouse (Redshift/Snowflake/BigQuery)
- ETL Tools (Airflow, dbt)

## Steps

1. Define source data schema and requirements
2. Design dimensional model (Star/Snowflake schema)
3. Build ETL pipeline using Python
4. Load data into warehouse
5. Run sample analytics queries

## Files

- `etl_pipeline.py`: Example ETL pipeline script
- `schema.sql`: DDL for warehouse tables

## How to Use

1. Review the schema and modify as needed for your source data.
2. Use the ETL pipeline script to extract, transform, and load sample data.
3. Connect to your data warehouse and run the analytics queries provided.
